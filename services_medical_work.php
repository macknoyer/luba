                        <p>Social services medical workers are the people whose primary specialty is helping people in need, whether it is mental health care, palliative medicine, hospice, or rehabilitative care centers. Medical social service employees in Medicare can be very narrow and specialized (for example, the worker deals only with patients with Alzheimer’s disease), and work with different medical conditions. Usually, these workers cooperate with medical professionals, like doctors and nurses.</p>
                        <p>At <strong>Luba`s home care</strong>, we believe that medical social services in New York are extremely important for everyone. And we will be happy to clarify for you, what precisely it is that our social service medical workers do for patients and their families.</p>
